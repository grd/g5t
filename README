Internationalization and localization support.

This module is a <<< subset >>> and rewrite of the Python gettext module 
in the Go language. It is NOT intended for use in a production environment.

	https://github.com/jkozera/g5t      (multi language support)


The main difference between this module and the Python gettext module is that
this one only uses unicode AND with only one language file at a time (which is 
good enough for most programs). This approach reduces the code size 
significantly.


This module contains only four exported functions:

	Parse()		// This is the ".mo" file parser and is overridable
	Setup()		// This function sets the translation
	String()	// This function returns a translated string
	StringN()	// This function returns a translated string in plural form


Usage (short):

	1) To use this package in your application, write this line (it's 
	   go-installable): 
	
		import "github.com/grd/g5t"
		
		
	2) In your application define functions (for singualar and plural):
	   
		func G(msg string) string { return g5t.String(msg) }
		func GN(msgid1, msgid2 string, n int) string { return g5t.StringN(msgid1, msgid2, n) }
	   
	   
	4) Code the rest of your program. When you want a string that needs to be 
	   translated, write G("string to translate") etc.
	
	5) Run for each ".go" file:
	
		xgettext -o messages.po -C -kG -kGN:1,2 yourprogramfile.go
   
	   
	6) If you want to place the translation files to a sub directory of 
	   your application, make a directory called "translations" (for example)
	   To locate your translations place this function in your app:
	   
		g5t.Setup("your_app", "directory_to_transl_files", "language", Parser)


	7) Translate "messages.po" with a text editor to a specific language and
	   save the file to "yourdomain.po". Then run
	   
	   msgfmt yourdomain.po
	   

	   Msgfmt creates "yourdomain.mo". Copy this file to the language
	   translation directory (in Debian this is "/usr/share/locale/")
 
	8) That's it.
